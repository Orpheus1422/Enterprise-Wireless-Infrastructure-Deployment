## 1. Introduction & Organizational Background

**[Your Organization Name]** is a forward-thinking company dedicated to operational excellence and robust technological enablement. To support our growing workforce and the increasing demand for flexible, reliable, and secure connectivity, we are seeking a qualified vendor to design, deploy, and manage a state-of-the-art enterprise wireless network.

This RFP outlines our requirements for a comprehensive wireless solution that will serve as a critical backbone for our daily operations.

## 2. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To provide seamless, high-performance, and secure wireless coverage across all office premises.
- To enhance employee productivity by supporting a wide range of devices and modern collaborative applications.
- To future-proof our network infrastructure by adopting the latest wireless standards.
- To ensure the network is manageable, scalable, and capable of supporting a high density of concurrent users.
- To implement enterprise-grade security measures to protect our network and data from unauthorized access.

## 3. Project Scope of Work

The selected vendor will be responsible for the following:

### 3.1. Pre-Deployment Planning
- **Site Survey:** Conduct a comprehensive active and passive wireless site survey to determine optimal access point (AP) placement, radio frequency (RF) channel planning, and power settings to ensure complete coverage and minimize interference.
- **Design Documentation:** Develop a detailed network design document including a bill of materials, network diagrams, and a projected RF coverage map.

### 3.2. Deployment & Implementation
- **Hardware Installation:** Physically install and mount all wireless access points, controllers, and necessary supporting hardware.
- **Configuration & Integration:** Configure all wireless infrastructure components, including SSIDs, VLANs, and security policies. Ensure seamless integration with the existing wired network infrastructure (switches, firewalls, and authentication servers).
- **Testing & Validation:** Perform rigorous testing to validate coverage, throughput, roaming capabilities, and security functionality against the project objectives.

### 3.3. Post-Deployment & Support
- **Documentation:** Provide "as-built" documentation and a comprehensive runbook for the IT team.
- **Training:** Conduct training sessions for our IT staff on the daily management, monitoring, and basic troubleshooting of the new wireless system.
- **Ongoing Maintenance & Support:** Offer a detailed plan for ongoing maintenance, firmware updates, and technical support.

## 4. Technical & Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Coverage & Performance
- Provide uniform coverage of **-67 dBm or stronger** across all indoor office areas, including conference rooms, common areas, and isolated spaces.
- Support the latest **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)** standard at a minimum to ensure high efficiency and performance in high-density environments.
- The network must have the capacity to handle a **minimum of 3 simultaneous connected devices per employee** without degradation in performance.

### 4.2. Security
- Mandatory support for **WPA3-Enterprise** for robust encryption and authentication.
- Implement **MAC address filtering** as a baseline access control measure.
- Support for network access control (NAC) solutions, such as integration with a RADIUS server (e.g., using PEAP or EAP-TLS).
- Provide guest network isolation, ensuring guest traffic is segmented from the primary corporate network.

### 4.3. Management & Monitoring
- The solution must include a centralized management platform (on-premise or cloud-based) for configuration, monitoring, and reporting.
- Provide capabilities for real-time network health monitoring, client analytics, and alerting on performance anomalies or security events.
- The system should generate regular reports on network usage, client distribution, and security incidents.

## 5. Vendor Qualifications

### 5.1. Experience
- Provide details of at least **two similar enterprise-scale wireless deployments** completed within the last three years. For each, describe the project scope, challenges, and outcomes.
- **Alternatively,** describe in detail two technical scenarios that demonstrate your team's expertise in troubleshooting complex wireless network issues or designing for high-density environments.

### 5.2. Certifications
- List relevant active certifications held by your project team members (e.g., CWNA, CWSP, CCIE Wireless, vendor-specific expert-level certifications).
- If no certifications are held, list five real, industry-recognized wireless certifications your team is interested in pursuing (e.g., CWNP series, Cisco Meraki Network Associate).

### 5.3. References
- Provide at least **three professional references** from clients for whom you have completed similar wireless infrastructure projects.

## 6. Proposal Submission Requirements

Vendors must include the following in their proposal:

### 6.1. Cost Structure
- A detailed total cost breakdown, including:
  - All hardware (Access Points, Controllers, etc.)
  - Software licenses (management platform, security features)
